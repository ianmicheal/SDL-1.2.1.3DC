# SDL_gfx Library

## SDL graphics drawing primitives and other support functions

The SDL_gfx library evolved out of the **SDL_gfxPrimitives** code which provided basic drawing routines such as lines, circles or polygons and **SDL_rotozoom** which implemented an interpolating rotozoomer for SDL surfaces.

### Current Components

The current components of the SDL_gfx library are:

1. **Graphic Primitives** (SDL_gfxPrimitves.h)
2. **Rotozoomer** (SDL_rotozoom.h)
3. **Framerate control** (SDL_framerate.h)
4. **MMX image filters** (SDL_imageFilter.h)

### Features

- The library is backwards compatible with the above-mentioned code.
- It is written in plain C and can be used in C++ code.

### Usage

To use the SDL_gfx library in your project, include the necessary headers:

```c
#include <SDL_gfxPrimitives.h>
#include <SDL_rotozoom.h>
#include <SDL_framerate.h>
#include <SDL_imageFilter.h>
```
