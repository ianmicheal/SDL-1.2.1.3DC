## How To Use

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and a C compiler installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SDL_image.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd SDL_image

# Compile the library
$ ./configure
$ make

# Install the library
$ sudo make install
```

## API

Include the following header in your code:

```c
#include "SDL_image.h"
```

### Loading Images

SDL_image provides three main functions for loading images:

1. **Load from file:**
   ```c
   SDL_Surface *IMG_Load(const char *file);
   ```

2. **Load from SDL_RWops:**
   ```c
   SDL_Surface *IMG_Load_RW(SDL_RWops *src, int freesrc);
   ```

3. **Load from SDL_RWops with specified image type:**
   ```c
   SDL_Surface *IMG_LoadTyped_RW(SDL_RWops *src, int freesrc, char *type);
   ```
   Where `type` is a string specifying the format (e.g., "PNG" or "pcx").

> **Note:** `IMG_Load_RW` cannot load TGA images.

### Creating Surface from XPM

To create a surface from an XPM image included in C source:

```c
SDL_Surface *IMG_ReadXPMFromArray(char **xpm);
```

## Dependencies

SDL_image relies on several libraries for full functionality:

- JPEG support: [JPEG library](http://www.ijg.org/)
- PNG support: [PNG library](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html) and [Zlib library](http://www.gzip.org/zlib/)
- TIFF support: [TIFF library](http://www.libtiff.org/)

## Build Instructions

If you have the dependencies installed in non-standard locations, you can specify the paths during configuration:

```sh
sh ./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/path/to/include" LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/lib"
```

After successful configuration, build and install the library:

```sh
make
sudo make install
```

> 💡 You may need to add `/path/to/lib` to your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for correct shared library loading.
