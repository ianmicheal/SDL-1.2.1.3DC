# üöÄ SDL-1.2.1.3DC with GLdc Integration for Dreamcast

### Historical Context

Back in 2004/2008, SDL integration on the Dreamcast was severely limited:
- Only worked with KGLX
- Supported a very restricted subset of OpenGL 1.2
- Hardware rendering capabilities were underutilized

### The Renaissance: 2020 Upgrade Initiative

In 2020, a major effort was undertaken to revolutionize SDL on the Dreamcast:
- Ported SDL to use GLdc
- Introduced proper support for hardware rendering
- Unlocked the full potential of the PowerVR chip

### Current Status (As of September 29, 2024)

The project has evolved significantly:
- Updated to run with the latest KallistiOS (KOS) 2.10 toolchain
- Fully compatible with SDL-1.2.1.3DC
- Seamlessly integrated with GLdc

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Full GLdc Compatibility**: Everything possible in standalone GLdc is now achievable within SDL-1.2.1.3DC+GLdc
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Enjoy identical functionality on both PC and Dreamcast
- **Hardware-Accelerated Rendering**: Leverage the Dreamcast's PowerVR chip for optimal performance
- **Modern Development Experience**: Utilize contemporary tools and practices for retro hardware
