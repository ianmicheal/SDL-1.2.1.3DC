# üöÄ SDL-1.2.1.3DC with GLdc Integration for Dreamcast

### Now Added: Primitive Types for OpenGL DC V.1.0

The following primitive types are taken from OpenGL for compatibility purposes. Please note that **not all types are fully implemented** in OpenGL DC Version 1.0.

```c
/* Primitive Types taken from GL for compatibility */
/* Not all types are implemented in OpenGL DC V.1.0 */
#define GL_POINTS                               0x0000
#define GL_LINES                                0x0001
#define GL_LINE_LOOP                            0x0002
#define GL_LINE_STRIP                           0x0003
#define GL_TRIANGLES                            0x0004
#define GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP                       0x0005
#define GL_TRIANGLE_FAN                         0x0006
#define GL_QUADS                                0x0007
#define GL_QUAD_STRIP                           0x0008
#define GL_POLYGON                              0x0009

```c they should all be implemented with some caveats
* GL_QUAD_STRIP doesn't cull properly if culling is enabled
* GL_POLYGON might not properly handle really strange input

### Historical Context
Back in 2004/2008, SDL integration on the Dreamcast was severely limited:
- Only worked with KGLX + OLD LIBGL BUGGY
- Supported a very restricted subset of OpenGL 1.2
- Hardware rendering capabilities were underutilized

### The Renaissance: 2020 Upgrade Initiative

In 2020, a major effort was undertaken to revolutionize SDL on the Dreamcast:
- Ported SDL to use GLdc
- Introduced proper support for hardware rendering
- Unlocked the full potential of the PowerVR chip

### Current Status (As of September 29, 2024)

The project has evolved significantly:
- Updated to run with the latest KallistiOS (KOS) 2.10 toolchain
- Fully compatible with SDL-1.2.1.3DC
- Seamlessly integrated with GLdc

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Full GLdc Compatibility**: Everything possible in standalone GLdc is now achievable within SDL-1.2.1.3DC+GLdc
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Enjoy identical functionality on both PC and Dreamcast
- **Hardware-Accelerated Rendering**: Leverage the Dreamcast's PowerVR chip for optimal performance
- **Modern Development Experience**: Utilize contemporary tools and practices for retro hardware
